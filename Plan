The Plan

There are two areas of development that must be worked on: 1. The Hearing Aid Device, 2. The Cloud Machine Learning support.
These two areas will be worked in parallel.

1. Hearing Aid Device
  - Switch from the openMHA build it yourself RaspberryPi based heading aid to the openMHA hearing aid research platform produced by Bat and Cat Sound Labs 
    * device was obtained June 28, 2021, approved by NIH and provided free of charge
  - Install openMHA version 4.16.0 on Mac 
    * accomplished July 1, 2021
  - Become fluent in the MatLab version of mhacontrol, so that the device can be used
  - Configure HARP (hearing aid research platform) to mimic the ReSound hearing aids recently obtained by DSP.
    * Have obtained the audiogram from Mayo
    * Have obtained the NAL-NL2 prescription used by Mayo to fit the ReSound hearing aids.
 
  - Determine how settings are changed in response to particular environments.
    * Coordinate with the Cloud ML activity to be able to associate settings with environments
    * Devise mechanism to score the setting with the environment.
    * Devise mechanism to improve setting when it does not meet user's needs for a given environment
    * Devise mechanism to capture and send to Cloud newly recognised environments.
  - Determine how settings are changed to make the enhanced sounds and voices not only clear, but pleasant to the hearer.
    * Devise mechanism to quantify "pleasant"
    * Understand available settings that influence "pleasantness"
    * Devise mechanism to associate quality of pleasant with different environments
 
 2. Cloud Machine Learning support
  - Obtain Google Research Cloud access for TPU accelerated processing
    * Have access till end of 2021
    
  - Start the process of categorizing environments
    * Receive environment samples with identifying id
    * develop training mechanism to identify environments
    
  - Communicate with HARP when environment is identified
