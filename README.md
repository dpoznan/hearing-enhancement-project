Crowdsourced Hearing Enhancement

The basic idea is that all the users share their experiences in order to improve each others hearing. 
They share: 
  1) sound environments 
  2) their hearing deficiencies and 
  3) success/failure of enhancement provided to them. 
  
Sharing is accomplished using the Cloud for storage and for processing.

Each user has earbuds and a smart phone and a connection to the internet and thus the Cloud. The earbuds provide the actual speaker that introduces enhanced sound to the user’s ears. The enhancement is tailored to the user and is based on the shared experiences of the other users.

The problem to be solved: 
Hearing quality is affected by the sound environment and the capabilities of the listener. A noisy environment can reduce   the quality of hearing as does a reduced capacity (being “hard of hearing”). Every sound environment is different as is every hearing disability. However there are similarities to be taken advantage of, when working to enhance the quality of hearing for individuals with normal or reduced hearing capability. Currently there is no hearing aid nor voice enhancing earbud that has sufficient flexibility, or adaptability to achieve real enhanced speech. 

Overview:
  1) The users wear earbuds and have a smart phone with internet access.
  2) The Cloud is available to provide storage and processing
  3)The current sound environment is captured by the earbuds and phone and passed up the the Cloud for identification.
  4) The Identification process identifies and classifies the sound and sound components. 
        (watching TV, in Joe’s Pub, in the weekly company conference, in math class..)
  5) The Cloud process selects a sound target to be enhanced, based on past experiences, which were provided by
        feedback from the user as well as feedback from the community of users (particularly when the sound environment 
        is new to the user.
  6) Using knowledge of the user's hearing capabilities and the proposed sound target, a set of required enhancement 
        tools is determined.
  7) Using knowledge of the users hearing capabilities and the proposed sound target, a set of enhancement parameters 
        for the selected tools is constructed and passed to the earbuds.
  8) Tools not currently present in the user’s earbuds are downloaded to the user’s earbuds.
  9) The parameter set is passed to the user’s earbuds.
  10) The earbuds process incoming sound and enhances the target.
  11) The user provides feedback as to quality of enhancement as well as selections of the target sound.
  12) Cloud adapts to the response with improvements or confirms that the decisions have been made correctly and 
        records that information for future reference.
